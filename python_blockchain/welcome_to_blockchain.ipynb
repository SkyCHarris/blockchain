    "\n",
    "1. Decentralized\n",
    "\n",
    "    No centralized source that controls the blockchain. Individuals that make up a blockchain are node operators. They run the software that connects the blockchain together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Transparency & Flexibility\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Everything that happens on-chain can be seen by everyone. Same rules for everyone.\n",
    "    Blockchain is pseudo-anonymous though.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Speed & Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "    Blockchains are verified by decentralized collective. Settlement/withdrawal is substantially faster. Seconds to minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Security & Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "    Can't be changed, tampered with, corrupted. Big security on data and transactions. Makes hacking harder. Assets are locked on the blockchain forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Removal of Counterparty Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "    Removes many loopholes. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Trust Minimized Agreements\n",
    "\n",
    "    Need to trust a brand to execute faithfully. With crypto we're moving to math-based agreements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Major takeaways: free and trustless. Engage how we wish, no centralized body influence. Rules are the same for everyone. New world of economic opportunity. More digital lives means more centralized control."
